Thin CMS
========

A CMS system that has a thin Perl/Plack server side BE with a JS FE.

This idea behind this project to create a simple and quick-to-setup CMS system
that will allow the user to build documents in MongoDB which can then be pulled
into an HTML page and displayed

The server side stuff handles incoming requests and determines the root dir and 
MongoDB connection to use based upon the requested domain.

All the above means I can knock out simple yet dynamic sites for my friends 
small businesses, events, etc. quickly. Even better, it means 'other people'
can produce standard HTML sites, give them to me to host on my little VPS and
with minmal changes I can allow the owner to be edit the page content.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
